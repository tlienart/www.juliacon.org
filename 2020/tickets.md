### Already purchased a ticket?

If you have already purchased a ticket, you can request a refund via the Eventbrite link in your ticket email.

The proceeds from JuliaCon are an important source of revenue for the Julia project, and goes a long way to provide funding for community infrastructure throughout the year.
If you do not ask for a refund, your ticket will be rolled over to next year (you will also be registered for this year's event).
