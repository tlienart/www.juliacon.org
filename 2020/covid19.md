# JuliaCon goes Virtual!

The JuliaCon organising committee has determined that the best course of action for the well being of all potential JuliaCon attendees is to hold JuliaCon remotely this year.
While the details are still being finalized, we are working hard to ensure we are still able to provide the amazing JuliaCon experience that those in the community have come to expect.
